A [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) plugin for 3D ray casting against meshes. Used to build [`bevy_mod_picking`](https://github.com/aevyrie/bevy_mod_picking). Contributions welcome!
  
</div>

## Uses

This plugin makes it simple to create ray casting sources, such as a transform (first person, third person shooter), or screenspace coordinates (mouse picking).

- Only meshes that you mark with a component will be checked for intersections.
- You can define which ray casting source(s) should interact with which mesh(es) by marking grouped sources and targets with the same type. 
- This plugin also provides some functionality to compute the intersection of rays with primitive shapes.
- Acceleration is provided using Bevy's AABBs and visibility culling.
- An immediate mode API is provided to allow raycasts on demand, as well as raycasting using components updated once per frame.

## Alternatives

For a more full featured and performant option, consider using [`bevy_rapier`](https://github.com/dimforge/bevy_rapier). Note that rapier is a full physics engine that can also do raycasting; by contrast, this crate prioritizes simplicity and ergonomics.

## Bevy Version Support

I intend to track the `main` branch of Bevy. PRs supporting this are welcome!

## Examples

Mouse picking using a ray cast built using screen space coordinates:

```shell
cargo run --example mouse_picking
```

Mouse picking using a ray cast built using screen space coordinates, for 2D meshes:

```shell
cargo run --example mouse_picking_2d
```

Ray casting from a camera using ray casts from the camera entity's GlobalTransform:

```shell
cargo run --example minimal
```

Manually compute raycast against primitive shape, and check for line-of-sight visibility
```shell
cargo run --example ray_intersection_over_mesh
```

*Optimization* Mouse picking over many meshes using AABBs:

```shell
cargo run --example bounding_volume
```

*Optimization* Mouse picking over complicated mesh using simplified mesh for the raycasting:

```shell
cargo run --example simplified_mesh
```
